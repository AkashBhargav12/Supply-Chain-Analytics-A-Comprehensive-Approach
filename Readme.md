# Objective

The main objective of this project is to use analytical techniques to gather insights to ensure seamless flow of products from suppliers to stores. The objectvies can be outlines as follows:

1. Apply probability distributions and confidence interval building to analyze customer complaints and total spend.
2. Conduct hypothesis testing to compare the total spend of customers based on their complaint status.
3. Develop and interpret a multiple regression model to explain customer total spend.
4.  Formulate and solve a linear programming problem for production planning.
5.  Utilize decision models to determine the best manufacturing strategy under different demand scenarios.

## User Story

As the Supply Chain Manager, I want to apply various analytical techniques to our customer data so that we can derive insights and support decision-making processes for improving our supply chain operations. I need probability calculations, hypothesis testing, regression modeling, and linear programming to provide actionable recommendations for our upcoming sales and operations planning meeting.

## Target Audience

1. General Manager
2. Supply Chain Manager
3. Sales Manager
4. Operations Manager
5. Procurement Manager

## Data Source

The data for this analysis has been obtained from a confidential source and mimics real-time events, names, products, and places. It has been synthesized to mask the original source.
